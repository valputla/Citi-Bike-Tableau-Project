## Conclusions and Considerations for Further Analysis

Based on the data, most users are part of the member program though membership declined slightly when comparing Jan 2021 to Jan 2022 stats. Riders between the ages of 17-25 are using CitiBike the most and riding the longest. Peak time to ride is between 5-6pm, suggesting most users take CitiBike for a ride after work. The most popular stations in January 2021 are in the medical district, likely influenced by COVID and Trader's Joe's. In January 2022, the most popular stations remained largely the same with the addition of a station near a shopping district, which may signal American's behavior return to pre-COVID times.
